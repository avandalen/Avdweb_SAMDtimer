# Avdweb_SAMDtimer

Attention: the new libraries Adafruit_ASFcore and Adafruit_ZeroTimer are changed and don't work anymore with the avdweb_SAMDtimer lib.
There is something with tc_callback_t. So use the OLDER Adafruit libraries (from 2017).

This has to be solved..................
Who can help??????????
